# Crossword Solver

Crossword Solver is a program that locates solutions for 8-way crosswords.
The 8-way crosswords are different from the typical crosswords we might think of.
Instead of filling in words, in this crossword letters are already filled out in a grid.
We are given a set of pictures, and we try to find the words that represent the picture.
The words can be in 8 different orientations in the word grid:
- from left to right
- from top-left to bottom-right
- from top to bottom
- from top-right to bottom left, and so on

The crossword solver is a tool in which you can input a picture of an 8-way crossword, 
give it some words to search, and it will find where those words are located in the word grid.
